# Deep-Learning-Specialisation-Coursera
It's a specialization in Deep-Learning on the platform of Coursera provided by deeplearning.ai .

As I progress with the course, I will be uploading the solutions of the programming assignments here.

The Courses are in the following order:
1) Neural Networks and Deep Learning
2) Improving Deep Neural Networks : Hyperparameter tuning, Regularisation and Optimization
3) Structuring Machine Learning Projects
4) Convolutional Neural Networks
5) Sequence Models
